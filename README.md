- 👋 Hi, I’m @KisanoWasTaken
- 👀 I’m interested in WAY too many things and learning too much.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Full Stack Development, Game Development, Music Theory and Art. Oh and video editing.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on pretty much anything that doesn't cost me more sleep than I'm already sacrificing now.
- 📫 How to reach me: You can find me on NewGrounds and my email is kisanosano@proton.me! i'm also on YouTube.
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm quite a horror freak, so please suggest some good horror movies. Also, I listen to jazz and hardcore (yes, they are complete polar opposites in music)
