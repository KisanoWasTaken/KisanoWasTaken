- 👋 Hi, I’m @KisanoWasTaken
- 👀 I’m interested in WAY too many things and learning too much.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on: Nothing. Yet.
- 📫 How to reach me: You can find me on NewGrounds and my email is kisanosano@proton.me! i'm also on YouTube i guess...
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm quite a horror freak, so please suggest some good horror movies. Also, I listen to jazz and hardcore (yes, they are complete polar opposites in music)
